# Graphics Programming - OMN-RB-01

The robot that we designed and created for this graphics programming assignment is called OMN-RB-01. The inspiration of the project comes from the anime character called Omnimon from the popular Japanese series Digimon. 

The design of the robot is separated into several parts, including the head, body, waist, left and right hands, left and right legs, arm weapons (sword and cannon), and shield. The robot model was divided into three separate parts, each constructed individually by team members. Various geometric shapes, such as cubes, cuboids, pyramids, triangular prisms, spheres, and cylinders, were utilized to achieve the final form and aesthetic of the robot model.

## Technology Used 

- OpenGL Library (Implementation)
- Microsoft Paints (Design)
- Diagram.net (Wireframming)

# Installation Guide 

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Visual Studio installed on your machine with C++ development tools.
- Make sure OpenGL and any required libraries are set up in your Visual Studio environment.

## Steps to Set Up and Run the Project
